  # NativePHP  
  Laravel has just introduced a new feature where it can now be used to create a desktop application using the NativePHP plugin.


  ## Run Locally  
  Clone the project  

  ~~~bash  
    git clone https://github.com/imamulikhlas/NativePHP.git
  ~~~

  Go to the project directory  

  ~~~bash  
    cd NativePHP
  ~~~

  Start development server  

  ~~~bash  
  php artisan native:serve
  ~~~

  ## Whats New ðŸ”¥  
  This is a repository that I am trying to develop to create a desktop application using NativePHP while also learning how NativePHP works. Currently, there are still many limitations since NativePHP itself is only available in the Alpha version.
